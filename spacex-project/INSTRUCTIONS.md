# Welcome to SpaceX Project! 🚀

Hi! I'm **Melina**, a candidate for a **Frontend Software Engineer** position. I have created a minimalist and functional website using **ReactJS**, **Apollo Client**, **HTML5** and **CSS3** for Desktop View. The colours used are based in a galaxy pallete.

## Why did I use these technologies?

I spent my weekend learning about Graphql and Apollo Client and I love it. These are very usefull to catch data in front-end side. ReactJS is a very comfortable framework for me to do any site that is why I used it. Also, it is the first framework that I started to learn. HTML5 and CSS3 are my friends since I started to programming at secondary school and I know them so well.

## ⭐ What could I improve? ⭐

If I had more time, I would make a responsive site and maybe I would have started with Mobile First design. And I would investigate how to test with Jest.

## How to run the app 📋
- You need [node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) and npm installed
- Then, you have to download my project
-  Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- And you have to run `yarn start` to start my project on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## How to use my site 👩‍💻
