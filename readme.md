# ðŸš€ Front-End Challenge

## `Introduction`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We will create a web Application using React with typescript on the front end, using the [SpaceX Graphql API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/).

## The Application
``INSTRUCTIONS.md``:
- Add prints of your application in the repository and use them in the readme
- Setup instructions
- How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission
- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time

## technologies used as part of solution
- React js library with typescript
- Apollo Client to get info from [SpaceX Graphql API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/). 
- Styled-Components library for styles
- Docker 

## Components and styles
