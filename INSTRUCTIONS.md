# Front-end test

## Prints

### Responsive

![Responsive](responsive.png "Responsive")

## Setups instructions

- Install the node_modules with the command: `npm i`
- Run the app with the command `npm start` available on localhost:3000.

## Tecnologies

- I decided to use React because I'm familiar with this tool for front-end and interface development, plus it's fast and easy to use. On the other hand, I also used Apollo because of the ease with which it allows API requests made in GraphQL.

## Improvements

- With a little more time, I would like to add animations, react-pagination and react-carousel to show both missions and images.
