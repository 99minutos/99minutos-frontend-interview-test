## 🔧 How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution(Built with)
- [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) (react, react-dom)
It is the library that I better know and for faster development
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) _(Development)_
You need babel to use current features of Ecmascript
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) _(Development)_
I need webpack for bundle my files
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) _(Development)_
I used Jest to implement some snapshots with enzyme
- [Date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) _(Development)_
It is useful for manage dates and improves the performance just using the feature that you need
