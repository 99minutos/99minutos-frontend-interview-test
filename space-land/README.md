# Space Land ðŸš€

## Welcome!
Welcome to missions made in space ðŸš€.
This page was made using the SpaceX Graphql API to show the missions that have been carried out in space and more detailed information about each mission.

## The Challenge
We'll be looking for **simple, well-designed and tested(only PL/SR)** code in the submission.

Please include a ``INSTRUCTIONS.md``:
- Add prints of your application in the repository and use them in the readme
- Setup instructions
- How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission
- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time

## Details
Use the [SpaceX Graphql API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) and create a project based on the following wireframe. Use your creativity to choose colors etc...

![Test Wireframe](wireframe-test.png "Test Wireframe")

### The app
#### Last Launches Component
- List the last 10 missions
- Clicking on the card, shows the **Mission** on right component
- Indicate what is the selected card

#### Mission Component
- Details of the mission (image, etc...)
- Button to external link

## Required
- Vue or React or Angular
- TDD (only SR)
- Responsive (Otional for JR / Required for SR)

## Desirable
- React using apollo client

## Deliverables
We expect this test to take around 4 hours, but not significantly more (your time is very valuable!). We're giving you a week from the date you receive it to complete it and send us your repo URL, using **the technology that you decide, of those mentioned in "required"**. Due to this, we ask that you also provide a `INSTRUCTIONS.md` with instructions for running your project, both api and frontend, along with setup instructions (or provide a Dockerfile and a `docker run` instruction).

### Bonus points
- Your code has tests.
- Perfect Pixel
- UI/UX Improvements
- Clean Code
