# Space Land ðŸš€

## Welcome!
Welcome to missions made in space ðŸš€.
This page was made using the [SpaceX Graphql API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) to show the missions that have been carried out in space and more detailed information about each mission.

![Space Land App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamNM/99minutos-frontend-interview-test-2/JR-miriamnava/space-land/src/assets/SpaceLand.jpg)

In the INSTRUCTIONS.md file are the instructions to see and use this application.

## Technological stack
- Figma- Use this page, it is easy for me to make my prototypes here.
- gitHub projects- To organize the execution of the application.
- React- I find it easy to be able to make the components, perform the functionality and also, the code is clean.
- SASS- I can more easily write my CSS using the same nesting structure as how I write my JSX or HTML.

## Improvements
- Use SASS to do the CSS, because it makes it easier and more practical for me to write my code.

## Next steps
- I would use apollo client, to improve my application.
- I would ask for Feedback on the achievements so far and implement them to improve the user experience when viewing missions in space.
