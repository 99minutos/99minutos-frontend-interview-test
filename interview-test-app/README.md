## USED TECHNOLOGIES 

#### React

An excellent library which I use to develop small-medium size applications for its ease of use and 
reduced boilerplate to go straight to the coding part with great performance.

#### Bootstrap, React-bootstrap & React-icons

I mainly used CSS3 Flexbox and Grids to achieve my layout and responsiveness but do all from scratch requires more time so I used
a few bootstrap components, this way I don't have to overwrite the bootstrap classes if I need a more custom Layout.

I used react-icons which has a collection of great icons libraries.

#### Jest, Enzyme & React Testing Library

To develop tests I used Jest to test JS functions, Enzyme to test React components and React Testing Library to do snapshots tests

## IMPROVEMENTS

I could have done more test cases 

## WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY?

I would have implemented more UI responsive layouts for more screen devices
